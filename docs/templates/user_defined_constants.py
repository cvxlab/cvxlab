"""User-defined constants for symbolic optimization problems.

This module allows you to define custom constant generation functions that 
extend the built-in constants available in cvxlab. Custom constants are 
automatically registered when this module is imported, and can be used in defining
constant types as property of variables in model settings.

USAGE:
------
Simply define your custom constant in this file as a regular function. 
Each function will be automatically available as a constant type in model settings.
The function is getting as input the dimension of the constant to generate (as a 
Tuple of integers representing rows and columns lengths), and returns as output
the generated constant (as a numpy array or scipy sparse matrix).

FUNCTION GUIDELINES:
-------------------
1. Use clear, descriptive function names
2. Include comprehensive docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises sections
3. Accept dimension as a Tuple[int] representing the shape (rows, cols)
4. Return numpy arrays or scipy sparse matrices
5. Include type hints for better code clarity
6. Validate inputs to ensure dimensions are valid tuples of integers
7. Raise appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs

COMMON PATTERNS:
---------------
- Vector validation: len(dimension) == 2 and any(i == 1 for i in dimension)
- Matrix validation: len(dimension) == 2 and all(i > 0 for i in dimension)
- Get size from vector: size = max(dimension)
- Reshape to dimension: array.reshape(dimension)

IMPORT REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------
Make sure to import necessary libraries at the top of this file (already required
by cvxlab): numpy is commonly used, but you can import others as needed.

For more examples, refer to:
    cvxlab/support/util_constants.py

EXAMPLE - 'identity matrix' CONSTANT:
------------------------------------
def identity_matrix(dimension: Tuple[int]) -> np.array:
    '''Generate a (square) identity matrix of the specified dimension.

    Args:
        dimension (Tuple[int]): The dimension of the matrix row/col.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: A square identity matrix of the specified dimension.

    Raises:
        exc.SettingsError: If passed dimension is not a tuple containing integers,
            or if it does not represent a vector (i.e., at least one element 
            must be equal to 1).
    '''
    if not isinstance(dimension, Tuple) or not \
            all(isinstance(i, int) for i in dimension):
        raise exc.SettingsError(
            "Constant definition | Identity matrix constant accepts as argument"
            "only a tuple of integers.")

    if len(dimension) != 2 or not any(i == 1 for i in dimension):
        raise exc.SettingsError(
            "Constant definition | Identity matrix accetps as argument a tuple "
            "representing a vector only (one dimension). Check variable shape.")

    return np.eye(max(dimension))
