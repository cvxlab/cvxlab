Conceptual model definition
---------------------------


CVXlab is a modeling framework. The modeling process must be grounded on a solid 
conceptualization and mathematical definition of the problem to be solved. Before 
starting the modeling process using CVXlab, it is necessary to have a clear 
understanding of the formulation of the problem (i.e. definition of objective 
function, constraints, variables).

Once the problem is well defined, the CVXlab modeling process can be summarized in 
the steps below.
