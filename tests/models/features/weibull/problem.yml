# SYMBOLIC PROBLEM

# definition of the constraints (vector expressions)

# for each technology (common intra-problem-set)
expressions: 

    # defining new yearly installed capacity exogenously    
    - Cap_new == Cap_new_ex

    # operational yearly capacity balance
    - Cap_op == Cap_start + T_yy @ (Cap_new - Cap_dis_start - Cap_dis_new)

    # yearly disposal of initially avaialble capacity (with residual lifetime)
    - Cap_dis_start == mult(Cap_start, weib(lt_start, sf, y_range, 1))

    # yearly disposal of new capacity (with full lifetime)
    - Cap_dis_new == weib(lt, sf, y_range, 2) @ Cap_new
